AdvSecureNet is a Python library to for Machine Learning Security. It has been developed by [Melih Catal](https://github.com/melihcatal) at [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) as a part of his Master's Thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Manuel GÃ¼nther](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/aiml/people/guenther.html).

The library provides a set of tools to generate adversarial examples and to evaluate the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. It also provides a set of tools to train robust machine learning models. The library is built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). It is designed to be modular and extensible. So, anyone can easily run experiments with different configurations.
